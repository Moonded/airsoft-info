title: Basic Explanation

Very similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not leave visible markings on their
target and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets sometimes leave bruises or welts on exposed skin
(protective gear recommended), the game relies heavily on an honor system in which players who have been hit
are expected to call themselves out by shouting "HIT". Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition, but
often ranges from action shooting to short organized live action role-playing (LARP) scenarios, close
quarters battle skirmishes, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. It is played in
indoor courses or outdoor fields. Combat situations on the field may involve the use of genuine military
tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment
and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. A game is normally kept safe by trained
professionals acting as supervisors and umpires.

Before gameplay, an airsoft gun's muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually
measured in feet per second (FPS) or Joules, a measurement of kinetic energy. Some countries have a set
velocity or muzzle energy restriction; guns shooting over the legal velocity can be confiscated. Some
playing fields further restrict minimum engagement distances,[8] requiring players to yell "Bang Bang!" or
another phrase instead of shooting other players at close distances. This is done to prevent possible
injuries from short range, high energy pellets.
